REQURIEMNENT GATHERING
=======================================================================================================================

The guys in the group realized that the process involved in booking the soccer pitch at the Brunei sports complex was 
not proper. In the sense that sometimes we encountered some issues after paying for a particular time; then our booking 
times coincide with others. This wasn't the best. We went ahead and asked some other students and they confirmed it 
was a problem.
Fast forward, we went to the Sport complex to inquire about this from the officials. We learnt from Tina that they are
actually in the process of building a solution to fix this but it's still in production. We also learnt they have no
software to store information at the gym (the members and payment receipts).

Hence our group decided to build a solution hopefully to deliver the following
1. Allow anyone to be able to book for sporting activities and pay (soccer, basketball, etc)
2. Allow anyone to register and become a gym member and access his/her info there (personal info, payment receipts, etc)and allow payment for gym subscription
3. Allow officials to track payment, number of members at the gym, number of booking and other data analysis related.
